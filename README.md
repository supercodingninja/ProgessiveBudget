## Repository Description

 I built a budgeting application, in order to keep track of my financespersonal finances. I utilized IndexedDB, cache API, and Service Workers, which provided an offline experience for the application.  Yes, the user will be able to work online and update information without missing a beat!  The application automatically saves to your device local storage; and will remain there until you clear out your browser's cache!  I will also use webpack, to minimize CSS an JavaScript, to implement tree-shaking.

## User Story
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

### As A Client
I want something that will measure and optimize the performance of my web applications. Today many of my users around the world, can access the web from older mobile devices; which means slower connections.  As our web applications continue to grow both, in size and complexity, so does my customers load times on their; which means that I can potentially lose them to competitors, if I do not address this, quickly.  I want to ensure that all of users have a good experience, optimizing performance is also an important consideration.

### As A Developer
    1.  I want to use tools such as Chrome Devtools, and Google Lighthouse; which are my primary tools for measuring web application performance.  Devtools allows me to monitor network traffic ,and inspect the size of resources downloaded to the browser; such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images.  Lighthouse provides a performance scoring system, based on metrics; such as application bundle size, time to interaction, time to first meaningful paint, and more!

    2.  In order to deliver smaller application bundle sizes to the client, I'll perform several optimizations that involve compressing assets. This includes minifying JavaScript and CSS files, as well as compressing images. Another technique utilized to improve initial bundle size, will be lazy loading, where we will defer loading certain assets until they're needed by the application.

## Repositiory End-Goal Criterea
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Make it a point to tackle new code, weekly (at least, periodaclly); and break it down.  Try to understand the concepts, yourself.  This only makes you more credible, and a stonger developer: because you've taken the tim to study!  Remember this also, as a developer, your goal should be designing NEW experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had- even better, in a way that they do not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development.
